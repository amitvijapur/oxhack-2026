# OXHack preparation

- [x] Close Discord research at Amit's request. No server messages were accessed.
- [x] Save Amit's Granola brief and label uncertainties and transcription issues.
- [x] Inspect local Git tooling and prepare a minimal repository plan.
- [x] Review the brief and repository proposal against Amit's notes.
- [x] Agree and publish the shared repository scaffold and main coding harness while idea selection continues.

## Repository and harness discussion

- [x] Inspect the session's actual working directory and applicable instructions. It remains `/Users/amit/Desktop/Hackathons/OXHack/`.
- [x] Review the existing proposal and verify Delta's current product description from its official site.
- [x] Clarify the team setup. Amit uses Codex with Cortex; teammates use Claude Code and shared repository rules.
- [x] Agree repository owner, name, and initial visibility: `amitvijapur/oxhack-2026`, private. Amit requires public visibility before submission.
- [x] Verify teammate handles from Amit's supplied image and send write-access invitations to `meep-boop`, `arjn15`, and `iloveclouduk`.
- [x] Create the agreed minimal shared scaffold and private remote; verify main and the scaffold from a fresh clone.
- [x] Verify accepted write access for `meep-boop`, `arjn15`, and `iloveclouduk` through GitHub's collaborator permissions API.
- [ ] Once application code exists, verify application setup from a fresh clone.

## Mixed-tool harness comparison

- [x] Verify Cortex's local capabilities and portability constraints without copying personal configuration into the team repo.
- [x] Check official Codex and Claude Code docs for shared project instructions and repository skills.
- [x] Compare GSD, OpenSpec, GitHub Spec Kit, and Superpowers against the existing Cortex/OMC setup and a 25-hour time budget.
- [x] Recommend the minimum shared repository harness and at most one additional workflow, with evidence and clear tradeoffs. See `research/harness-comparison.md`.
- [x] Record findings in the repository plan and Obsidian, and complete an independent portability review.
- [x] Agree the proposed shared harness with Amit. Cortex stays local to Amit; the team follows shared repository rules.

## Shared scaffold and Rust/Zed assessment

- [x] Create portable `AGENTS.md`, the `CLAUDE.md` import, README, and ignore rules, without application dependencies or a framework.
- [x] Check official Zed language support and distinguish the editor choice from the Delta prize condition in the supplied brief.
- [x] Confirm the workload requiring speed is the project algorithm. Amit wants Rust kept under consideration without selecting a language or framework yet.
- [ ] Confirm Rust experience if needed when selecting the implementation language.
- [x] Review shared rules for compatibility and verify the initial files without running package installs. The Claude import and local Markdown links pass; no Cargo or application dependency manifest was created.
- [x] Record agreed decisions and remaining questions in the repository plan. The existing Obsidian build log is maintained separately.
- [x] Initialize and publish `amitvijapur/oxhack-2026`; verify its private visibility, main branch, and initial remote commit.
- [ ] Make the repository public before submission, after reviewing its contents and confirming event repository rules. Exact submission time remains unknown.

## Team access, CI, and repository security

- [x] Verify `meep-boop`, `arjn15`, and `iloveclouduk` from Amit's image, invite them, and confirm all three accepted with write access.
- [x] Confirm the supplied Granola ceremony notes are present on GitHub and link them clearly from the README.
- [x] Inspect workflow permissions and security settings, then confirm private-repo branch protection by a successful update and independent readback.
- [x] Add stack-neutral CI for repository hygiene and secret scanning, with pinned dependencies and minimal permissions. Local positive and negative checks and independent review passed.
- [x] Document the PR workflow and configure one approval, current GitHub Actions checks, resolved conversations, linear history, admin enforcement, and protections against force pushes/deletions. GitHub readback confirms enforcement on the private repo.
- [x] Verify CI with both passing runs and a safe deliberate failure, independently review the change, and integrate it. PR #2 merged as `ce40669`; clean PR run `40092846642` and main run `40092935972` passed.
- [x] Prove hosted CI rejects a temporary trailing-whitespace defect. Run `40092708257` failed `Repository checks` on that defect and passed `Secret scan`; remove the probe before merge.
- [x] Verify effective GitHub settings and accepted collaborator access. Actions require full SHA pins, permit GitHub-owned actions, use read-only tokens, and cannot approve PRs. Dependabot alerts and security fixes are enabled.
- [ ] Merge the follow-up configuration/verification PR after one teammate approves it. The active protection is already correct; the stored request must omit legacy `contexts` when using `checks`.

## Team kit proposal (owner: Ahmed)

- [x] Compare Ahmed's Claude Code team kit with the agreed harness and list each piece's fit and clashes in `research/team-kit-proposal.md`.
- [ ] Amit ticks the pieces to adopt, or declines the proposal.
- [ ] If any are ticked, open one PR adding only those pieces, with verification results.

## Review

24 October 2026: Discord was inaccessible and Amit then cancelled that research. The Granola notes are the working event brief. Local Git and author identity are available. GitHub CLI authentication for `amitvijapur` was successfully verified outside the sandbox; the earlier restricted check is superseded and no re-login is needed. The plan is in `research/repository-plan.md`. Repository identity, visibility, harness, and accepted teammate access are confirmed. Stack, data source, and exact submission deadline remain open.

The private repository is live at https://github.com/amitvijapur/oxhack-2026 with the shared Cortex/Codex/Claude Code arrangement and supplied Granola notes. All three teammates from the image have accepted write access. PR #2 added CI, dependency controls, and team documentation; the deliberate whitespace defect was rejected and removed before the clean revision merged. Both required jobs passed on the PR and main. Main protection is active and was independently read back from GitHub, including one approval, current GitHub Actions-issued checks, resolved conversations, linear history, no force pushes/deletions, stale-review dismissal, latest-push approval, and admin enforcement. A follow-up PR corrects the stored API payload and records verification; it needs a teammate approval under those active rules. No application exists yet, so runtime correctness/performance checks remain pending. Rust is a candidate for algorithm performance. Keep the repo private until the planned review and public transition before submission; exact deadline and event eligibility rules remain open.
